Detailed Application Workflow

Module 1: User Management
Registration:

Users sign up by providing their email, password, and role (e.g., student, mentor).
Backend validates input, encrypts passwords, and stores the user in the database.
Default role: "student" (can be changed to "mentor" later if required).
Profile Management:

After signing up, users complete their profiles:
Skills: List of expertise (e.g., ReactJS, Python).
Academic background: Degree, university, and relevant achievements.
Contact details: Phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.
Interests: Tags to help with matching (e.g., AI, Mobile Development).
Users can update their profile anytime.
Authentication:

JWT-based authentication for secure login.
Role-based access control (e.g., Admin has extra permissions).
Notifications:

Users receive notifications (e.g., team requests, profile matches).
Notifications should have a type (e.g., "team_request") and status (read/unread).

Post Matching:

Other users are notified of posts matching their skills.
Users can filter/search posts based on skills, academic field, or project type.

Module 3: Team Formation
Team Management:

Users can create teams for specific projects.
Teams include:
Name (e.g., "AI Innovators").
Members: Each member's role is defined (e.g., "backend developer").
Status: Active or completed.
Requests to Join:

Users can request to join a team or invite others to join.
Notifications sent to respective users.
Team Chat:

In-app messaging for team communication.

Each team has a dashboard showing:
Tasks: To-do list, in-progress, and completed tasks.
Milestones: Key goals for the project.
Progress tracking: Visual progress indicators (e.g., percentage completed).
Task Management:

Teams can assign tasks to members.
Tasks include:
Title, description, deadline, and status.
Milestones:

Define project milestones (e.g., "Prototype complete").
Monitor milestone progress.

Module 5: Notifications
Notification Triggers:

New post matches a user’s skills.
A team request is sent.
