General Spring Boot Core Concepts
Spring Boot Basics:

Setting up a Spring Boot application.
Dependency Injection.
Configuration using application.properties or application.yml.
Spring Web:

RESTful API development with Spring MVC (@Controller, @RestController, @RequestMapping).
Handling GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.
Spring Data MongoDB:

Defining repositories (@Repository).
Querying data using MongoRepository and @Query annotation.
Aggregation pipelines for advanced queries.
Using indexes to optimize queries.
Authentication & Security
JWT (JSON Web Token):

Setting up user authentication with JWT.
Generating and validating tokens.
Securing APIs using @PreAuthorize and @Secured.
Spring Security:

Role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Student, Mentor).
Password encryption (e.g., BCryptPasswordEncoder).
OAuth2 (Optional):

Enabling third-party login with Google, GitHub, or other providers.
File and Image Management
File Uploads:

Uploading files (images, documents) using MultipartFile.
Configuring file storage in a local directory or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).
File Deletion:

Implementing APIs to delete files from storage.
Serving Static Content:

Serving images/files via REST API endpoints or directly.
Real-Time Communication
WebSockets:
Setting up real-time communication for team chats.
Using Spring WebSocket with @EnableWebSocket and @MessageMapping.
Search & Filtering
Custom Queries:

Writing custom MongoDB queries using @Query.
Pagination and sorting with Pageable.
Text Indexing and Search:

Using text indexes in MongoDB for searching profiles, posts, and teams.
Notifications
Event-Driven Programming:

Using Spring Events to trigger notifications.
Publishing and subscribing to events.
Push Notifications (Optional):

Implementing push notifications via Firebase or WebSocket.
Project and Team Management
Task Management APIs:

CRUD operations for tasks and milestones.
Relating tasks to specific teams and users.
Dashboard Aggregation:

Using MongoDB aggregation for project progress tracking.
Testing
Unit Testing:

Writing tests with JUnit and Mockito.
Testing service layers and controllers.
Integration Testing:

Setting up integration tests for end-to-end functionality.
Deployment
Docker:

Containerizing the Spring Boot application for easy deployment.
Cloud Deployment:

Deploying the application on cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Heroku.
Additional Concepts
Email Sending:

Sending emails using Spring Mail (e.g., for notifications).
Swagger/OpenAPI:

Documenting your APIs for better collaboration and testing.
Caching (Optional):

Improving performance using caching with Spring Cache and Redis.
Scheduled Tasks:

Using @Scheduled for periodic background tasks like sending reminders.
Learning Plan
Phase 1: Core Spring Boot (Basics, REST APIs, Spring Data MongoDB).
Phase 2: Security (JWT, Spring Security, Role-based access).
Phase 3: Advanced Features (WebSockets, File Management, Notifications).
Phase 4: Deployment and Optimization (Docker, Caching, Cloud).
